	///	@remark Immortality of WatchCell instance.
	///			WatchCell is managed by Chunks and Chunks set used instances to some
	///			index for chaining linked list. in order to hand over quickly to
	///			caller when it requires Chunks to alloc new an instance.
	///
	///			because used up element will be set to integer, which is for index,
	///			if WatchCell has no widx in front of its member, its blk member-variable
	///			definitely would be polluted and accessing it causes Undefined Behavior.
	///
	///			and we need the blk that can be used after it freed, this is why we
	///			put an additional value, next. see @Block to know the reason.
