        //  treat it like a pointer. instead, I won't declare a pointer at all.
        //
        //  so we need to check nulity of a reference but compiler always optimize it to true
        //  when it meets checking of a pointer to a reference.
        //  but if we do some pointer arithmetic to an address of nulled reference, it won't be
        //  optimized.
        //  and we need to add '1' as a pointer to char type. because it's the only type that
        //  we can guarantee it'll be always size 1 when this software is built on any platform or
        //  architecture.
