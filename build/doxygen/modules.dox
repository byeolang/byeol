/// @brief Byeol Language Architecture Modules Documentation

/// @defgroup indep
/// @brief Platform Dependent Layer
/// Platform-dependent code layer that contains all platform-specific implementations.
/// This layer handles all platform-specific code and enables the rest of the system to operate 
/// platform-independently. Conditional compilation (`#IF`, `#ELSE`, etc.) is only permitted in this module.

/// @defgroup clog
/// @brief Logging subsystem that handles all logging operations.
/// Provides configurable log levels and output formatting with thread-safe logging implementation.
/// This layer ensures consistent logging across the entire system.

/// @defgroup meta
/// @brief Type metadata management layer that collects and manages type metadata.
/// Provides runtime type information and supports reflection capabilities for the byeol language.
/// Essential for dynamic type operations and introspection.

/// @defgroup memlite
/// @brief Lightweight memory management layer with custom memory pool-based allocation.
/// Provides direct memory management for performance optimization and reduces garbage collection 
/// overhead through efficient memory pool strategies.

/// @defgroup leaf
/// @brief Leaf Language Parsing Layer that handles leaf language parsing.
/// Parses configuration information using the leaf language (derived from byeol) and handles 
/// `manifest.leaf` files in byeol pack distribution for structured configuration management.

/// @defgroup core
/// @brief Core language layer containing byeol AST and core language features.
/// Contains the byeol Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), handles package loading and management, 
/// and implements the fundamental features of the byeol programming language.

/// @defgroup sys
/// @brief System bundle pack that includes the standard library and built-in functionality.
/// Provides the standard library and built-in functionality that comes with the byeol 
/// language distribution.

/// @defgroup frontend
/// @brief Command Line Interface frontend for the byeol language.
/// Provides the main entry point and user interface for interacting with the byeol 
/// language system through command line operations.
