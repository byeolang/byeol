WORLD, <br/>The new programming language.
=======================================

	! Please be advised that World can't support below features now. we're work in progress.

### What's this?
World is a interpreter and visual IDE for new programming language, World language.
it has following main features.

> * anchor-way development: You can get "so immediately" feedbacks whenever you codes.
		there is no any a "compile" thing. if you're writing down your codes, means that 
		you're in debugging	at the same time.
>
> 
> * Touch the instances: Basically, in order to make your function or class with World, 
		you should write somethings as a text. like other launguages.
		But, because of lack of compling, you always are in a middle of runtime envrionment
		whenever you codes your software. You can see which interactions are made of between
		classes and functions in visualized 3d graphics. 
		Visualization can get strong points that make you focus the whole picture of your
		software.
>
> * ModuleStore: Module is simply plug-in. mostly based on c++. you download modules
		which you want anytime.
>
> * Easy to use: we hope who aren't a programmer could join us to make a program with
		World. its IDE will be served as a classic GAME. pixel art, particle effects, retro
		sound fx, RPGistic UI, Worldmap, quest and archivement.


### Development 
> * CMake + GDB + GCC + python(for some scripts) + java
> * Windows + minGW only.
> * fully made of C++.


### How to Start
#### Let's Build

Preparing: to build World, following softwares will be needed.
    		
	python over 3.x, git, cmake, g++ and make,

if you're trying on windows, then it's recommended to install minGW install these softwares on your own.

Then, just enter:
		
	python ./build/builder.py build

All script you need for doing something on World is just at builder.py.
For more information, try "builder.py help"

#### Let's make something with World!
	
	Oh,... Ummmm. Not yet.
