## v0.01a Dust Update build# 9444
it was 02-25 2016.
Dust is the name of an update used by the 'Node Engine' project that was origin of the 'world language'.
'NodeEngine' is a result of consideration how to visualize programming elements and let users express and orgranize their thoughts in visual. Unfortunately, as a result of deliberation, I had to accept not to release to public because it's not enough useful to what I intended to be.

it has been developed by myself for quite a while, so even if it's not released officially I want to keep it below as records.
